# Object_classification_in_nanoimages
Implementation code for MCMC sampler with MH, RJ-MCMC and MCMH algorithms.

This code provides an example of implementing the algorithm proposed by Konomi et. al (2013) in their article titled "Bayesian object classification of gold nanoparticles." - The Annals of Applied Statistics, 7(2):640668, 2013
